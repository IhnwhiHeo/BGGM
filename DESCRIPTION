Description: This package is described in Williams and Mulder (2019) and Williams (2018). 
    The methods are separated into two Bayesian approaches for inference: hypothesis testing 
    and estimation. The former is described in Williams and Mulder (2018a), and allows for 
    testing for the presence of edges with the Bayes factor. One-sided hypothesis testing is 
    also possible. These methods can also provide evidence for the null hypothesis. There are 
    extensions for confirmatory hypothesis testing in GGMs, that can include inequality or 
    equality constraints on the partial correlation. The estimation based methods are described 
    in Williams (2018). The methods offer advantages compared to classical methods, in that a 
    measure of uncertainty is provided for all parameters. For example, each node has a 
    distribution for the variance explained. Measure of out-of-sample performance are also available.

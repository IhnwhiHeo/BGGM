# Introduction
On a Facebook methods group, there was a question about testing hypotheses in network model. In 
the comments, it was suggested that **BGGM** could be used to test the hypothesis. And it turns
out that **BGGM** really shines for testing expections or predictions. In this vignette, I demonstrate 
three ways to go about testing the same hypothesis, which was essentially testing for a difference
in the **sum** of partrial correlations between groups.

### R package
```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# need the developmental version
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) { 
  install.packages("remotes")   
}   

# install from github
remotes::install_github("donaldRwilliams/BGGM")
library(BGGM)
```

### Data
For demonstrative purposed, I use the `bfi` data and test the hypotheses in males and females

```
# data
Y <- bfi

# males
Y_males <- subset(Y, gender == 1, select = -c(education, gender))[,1:5]

# females
Y_females <- subset(Y, gender == 2, select = -c(education, gender))[,1:5]
```

# Approach 1: Posterior Difference
The first approach

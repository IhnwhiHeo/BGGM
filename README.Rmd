# BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models

[![CRAN Version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/BGGM)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BGGM)
[![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/BGGM)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BGGM)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/donaldRwilliams/BGGM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/donaldRwilliams/BGGM)


The `R` package **BGGM** provides tools for making Bayesian inference in
Gaussian graphical models (GGM). The methods are organized around two general 
approaches for Bayesian inference: (1) estimation [@Williams2019] and (2) hypothesis 
testing [@Williams2019_bf]. The key distinction is that the former focuses on either 
the posterior or posterior predictive distribution, whereas the latter focuses on 
model comparison with the Bayes factor.

## Installation

To install the latest release version (1.0.0) from CRAN use
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}	
install.packages("BGGM")	
```


The current developmental version can be installed with	

```{r, eval = FALSE}	
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) {	
  install.packages("remotes")	
}	
remotes::install_github("donaldRwilliams/BGGM")
```

Note that the developmental version is recommended, due to the algorithims being written in `c++` and 
support for all data types (e.g., ordinal). As of 5/15/2020, the developmental version is essentially
**BGGM** version 2.0.0.



# Overview
The methods in **BGGM** build upon existing algorithms that are well-known in the literature.
The central contribution of **BGGM** is to extend those approaches:

1.  Bayesian estimation with the novel matrix-F prior distribution [@Mulder2018]
  
    + [Estimation](#bayesian-estimation) [@Williams2019]

2. Bayesian hypothesis testing with the matrix-F prior distribution [@Mulder2018].

    + [Exploratory hypothesis testing](#Exploratory) [@Williams2019_bf].
  
    + [Confirmatory hypothesis testing](#Confirmatory) [@Williams2019_bf].
    
3. Comparing Gaussian graphical models
    
    + [Partial correlation differences](#partial-correlation-differences) [@Williams2019]
    
    + [Posterior predictive check](#posterior-predictive check) [@williams2020comparing]
    
    + [Exploratory hypothesis testing](#exploratory-(groups)) [@williams2020comparing]
    
    + [Confirmatory hypothesis testing](#confirmatory-(groups)) [@williams2020comparing]

4. Extending inference beyond the conditional (in)dependence structure

    +  [Predictability](#Predictability) [@Williams2019]
    
    +  [Posterior uncertainty intervals](#posterior-uncertainty) in the 
       partial correlations [@Williams2019]
       
    +  [Custom Network Statistics](#custom-network-statistics)
    
    
The computationally intensive tasks are written in `c++` via the `R` package **Rcpp** [@eddelbuettel2011rcpp] and the `c++` library **Armadillo** [@sanderson2016armadillo]. The Bayes factors are computed with the `R` package **BFpack** [@mulder2019bfpack]. Furthermore, there are plotting functions
for each method, control variables can be included in the model (e.g., `~ gender`), and there is support for missing values (see `bggm_missing`).

## Supported Data Types

* **Continuous**: the continuous method was described [in  @Williams2019].

* **Binary**: the binary method builds directly upon [-@talhouk2012efficient]
  that, in turn, built upon the approaches of [-lawrence2008bayesian] and
  [-webb2008bayesian;textual] (to name a few).
  
* **Ordinal**: the ordinal methods require sampling thresholds. There are two approach 
   included in **BGGM**. The customary approach described in [-@albert1993bayesian] 
   (the default) andthe 'Cowles' algorithm described in [- @cowles1996accelerating].
   
* **Mixed**: the mixed data (a combination of discrete and continuous) method was introduced
 in [-@hoff2007extending;textual]. This is a semi-parametric copula model
 (i.e., a copula GGM) based on the ranked likelihood. Note that this can be used for data
 consisting entirely of ordinal data (not restricted to "mixed" data).

# BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models

[![CRAN
Version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/BGGM)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BGGM)
[![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/BGGM)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BGGM)
[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/donaldRwilliams/BGGM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/donaldRwilliams/BGGM)

The `R` package **BGGM** provides tools for making Bayesian inference in
Gaussian graphical models (GGM). The methods are organized around two
general approaches for Bayesian inference: (1) estimation (Williams
2018) and (2) hypothesis testing (Williams and Mulder 2019). The key
distinction is that the former focuses on either the posterior or
posterior predictive distribution, whereas the latter focuses on model
comparison with the Bayes factor.

## Installation

To install the latest release version (1.0.0) from CRAN use

``` r
install.packages("BGGM")    
```

The current developmental version can be installed with

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) { 
  install.packages("remotes")   
}   
remotes::install_github("donaldRwilliams/BGGM")
```

Note that the developmental version is recommended, due to the
algorithims being written in `c++` and support for all data types. The
developmental version is essentially **BGGM** version 2.0.0.

# Overview

The methods in **BGGM** build upon existing algorithms that are
well-known in the literature. The central contribution of **BGGM** is to
extend those approaches:

1.  Bayesian estimation with the novel matrix-F prior distribution
    (Mulder and Pericchi 2018)
    
      - [Estimation](#bayesian-estimation) (Williams 2018)

2.  Bayesian hypothesis testing with the matrix-F prior distribution
    (Williams and Mulder 2019)
    
      - [Exploratory hypothesis testing](#Exploratory)
    
      - [Confirmatory hypothesis testing](#Confirmatory)

3.  Comparing Gaussian graphical models (Williams 2018; Williams et al.
    2020)
    
      - [Partial correlation
        differences](#partial-correlation-differences)
    
      - [Posterior predictive check](#posterior-predictive%20check)
    
      - [Exploratory hypothesis testing](#exploratory-\(groups\))
    
      - [Confirmatory hypothesis testing](#confirmatory-\(groups\))

4.  Extending inference beyond the conditional (in)dependence structure
    (Williams 2018)
    
      - [Predictability](#Predictability)
    
      - [Posterior uncertainty intervals](#posterior-uncertainty) in the
        partial correlations
    
      - [Custom Network Statistics](#custom-network-statistics)

The computationally intensive tasks are written in `c++` via the `R`
package **Rcpp** (Eddelbuettel et al. 2011) and the `c++` library
**Armadillo** (Sanderson and Curtin 2016). The Bayes factors are
computed with the `R` package **BFpack** (Mulder et al. 2019).
Furthermore, there are plotting functions for each method, control
variables can be included in the model (e.g., `~ gender`), and there is
support for missing values (see `bggm_missing`).

## Supported Data Types

  - **Continuous**: the continuous method was described in Williams
    (2018). Note that this is based on the customary [Wishart
    distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishart_distribution))

  - **Binary**: the binary method builds directly upon Talhouk, Doucet,
    and Murphy (2012) that, in turn, built upon the approaches of
    Lawrence et al. (2008) and Webb and Forster (2008) (to name a few).

  - **Ordinal**: the ordinal methods require sampling thresholds. There
    are two approach included in **BGGM**. The customary approach
    described in Albert and Chib (1993) (the default) and the ‘Cowles’
    algorithm described in Cowles (1996).

  - **Mixed**: the mixed data (a combination of discrete and continuous)
    method was introduced in Hoff (2007). This is a semi-parametric
    copula model (i.e., a copula GGM) based on the ranked likelihood.
    Note that this can be used for *only* ordinal data (not restricted
    to “mixed” data).

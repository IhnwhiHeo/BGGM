Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models

This package is described in Williams (2018). The methods offer advantages compared to classical methods, 
in that a measure of uncertainty is provided for all parameters. For example, each node has a distribution for
the variance explained. Measure of out-of-sample performance are also available. The model is selected with directional
Bayes factors.

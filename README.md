The `R` package **BGGM** provides tools for making Bayesian inference in
Gaussian graphical models (GGM). <!-- and (2) hypothesis testing -->
<!-- \insertCite{Williams2019_bf}{BGGM}. The key distinction is that the former focuses on either the -->
<!-- posterior or posterior predictive distribution, whereas the latter focuses on model comparison -->
<!-- with the Bayes factor. The methods in \strong{BGGM} build upon existing algorithms that are well-known in the literature. The central contribution of \strong{BGGM} is to extend those approaches: -->
